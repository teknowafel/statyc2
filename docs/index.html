            <p>What were you expecting? Maybe advertisements, some loading circle gimmick that took up the whole page, or maybe a 3 second wait before it even loaded? Unfortunately, If you're a fan of those things you've come to the wrong place.
                Why is this the wrong place you ask? Well, because this site is static! Unlike a traditional dynamic website where content is generated, you guessed it, dynamically upon loading the page, this site has been pre-rendered for your viewing pleasure.
                If you're wondering why that's important, you can see the benefits already. This site is
            </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>Fast</li>
                <li>Responsive</li>
                <li>Light on server resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And on top of all that, it looks great thanks to its easy templating system. Feel free to check out the other pages and take note of these benefits.
