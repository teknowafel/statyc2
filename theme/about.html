                This is the about page. It should include some more information pertaining to the website and its purpose. It may also contain copyright information, or contact information.
                For example, I can use the siteCopyright variable right here to show you the site's copyright information. Here it is: <br>
                {siteCopyright} <br>

                Statyc-py was my first attempt at writing a static site generator in Python. While it is functional and does support theming, it lacks more advanced templating features.
                Statyc2 is a complete rewrite of statyc-py, designed to fix the original's pitfalls when it comes to teplating. Now, with statyc2, html teplates can directly include python to be executed at rendering.
                Additionally, variables can be accesed and written to the rendered page inline with the use of curly brackets. Statyc2 is small with just 98 lines of python code, the rest of which is supposed to be
                included in the templates. This way, everything is modular and you can easily work on both the python and HTML aspects of templates concurrently.
